## Paper Shredder's GitHub for Pony Town!
<p>Hello world! I'm Paper, Azzy, or any of my <a href="https://prns.cc/nohej">other names</a> (^^). I tend to be awkward around strangers and people I don't know well, but I try not to bite! Though, I am quite fond of the block button. If you're curious, you can find a list of my interests <a href="https://rentry.co/all-hallows-eve">here</a>.</p>

<b>﹒Before You Interact:</b>
<br>➵ I'm one of those people that the guys at Cringe Culture Inc. hate; neurodivergent, queer, an alterhuman, and a selfshipper. To elaborate on one of those, I'm aroace and uncomfortable with romantic let alone s_xual gestures toward me, even as a joke.
<br>➵ I'm fine with talking with adults and kids alike but if you're creepy towards me or anyone else I'll block you without hesitation.
<br>➵ I headcanon most characters as aspec and tend to avoid ships that include characters I headcanon as aro. If you don't like that, that's not my problem.

<b>﹒A More Thorough List of People I Block:</b>
<br>➵ Sexists.
<br>➵ Racists. Yes, this counts <a href="https://whitewashing.carrd.co/">whitewashing</a>, it is racist.
<br>➵ Antisemites.
<br>➵ Islamophobes.
<br>➵ Anti-Palestine.
<br>➵ Queerphobes and exclusionists. I do not care for discourse.
<br>➵ Ableists.
<br>➵ People who enjoy, defend/justify, or joke about inc_st, p_do/z_o/n_crophilia, and s_xual violence. This includes proshippers.
<br>➵ People who go out of their way to harrass people with TT/TD. I could not care less about the debate of whether it's real or not, I just think harrassing people is gross.
<br>➵ People who feed into cringe culture (hating on furries, alterhumanity, oc x canon, selfships, etc).

<b>﹒Pony Town-Specific Information:</b>
<br>➵ If I have the 🌙 status, I'm AFK (away from keyboard). If I have the ⛔ status, I'm either AFK or not in the mood to interact with people I'm not friends with.
<br>➵ Feel free to cuddle or hide behind me, just don't be weird about it.
<br>➵ Feel free to take inspiration from my skins just don't straight up copy them (though I don't think anyone would copy me... raters on pony town are brutal).
